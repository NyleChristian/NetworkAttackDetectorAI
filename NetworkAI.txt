- Use Python tools to read packets on network
- Read useful header data for features
- Look for features outside of header
- Feed packet data to AI to open in controlled environment
- Use Datasets to train normal behavior
- Introduce common attacks to train AI
- Learn about random forest algorithm
-

- Preprocessing data
    -https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Icm8gofAuZI
    -split the data into training and test dataset with no overlap
    -ensure that distribution of unique items in columns is same
    -ensure that number of unique items in columns is same
    - Use Hot-encoding where each category of attack/ normal is classified by number
    - Split data into groups by attack type
    - Use StandardScaler() or similar to normalize data at 0 mean and 1 standard dev
    - Random forest is used to determine which features are most impactful
            -https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/random-forest-classifier-using-scikit-learn/
    - Use hyperparameter tuning techniques likes GridSearchCV or RandomSearchCV
        - most likely done before determining feature importance
    - precision vs recall vs f1 score 
    - focus on recall to reduce false negatives
    - Feature selection per attack type output as ordered list
    - Now, see if any better models for each attack type now that we have feature importance list
    - .fit() model to find individual attack
    - linear kernel SVM for each
        - create classifier type of SVM for each linear
        - fit the classifier to the training data

    -Data Preprocessing > hot-encoding categories > hyperparameter tuning for random forest hparameters > Use StandardScaler() to normalize data
   > split data into attack types and use random forest to determine feature importance for each > fit data giving table and output from training data > Pick best model for classifying 


- Train to understand normal behavior on sample Datasets
- Train to understand common attacks 
- Monitor activity coming from outside into network
- Log all activity
- Compare activity and classify based on pre-training
- Block suspicious behavior from outside based on classification
